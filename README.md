Tamagotchi on your wrist!


This is the source for for my PebblePet Watch App for the Pebble watch.

This code is unfinished and since I do not have the time to finish it I am publishing it so someone else can.
I do not own the majority of the graphics I used so I had to take them out.

There are currently some bugs that have gone unfixed:

1) Age will increase at an increased rate [eg; 10 hours elapsed = 2 days]  

2) Happiness will go negative instead of stopping at 0% [easy...]  

3) Watch App will lose connection to Phone App and not save properly  

4) Will randomly crash  


Features I wanted to include that never made it:

1) Minigames:  

  a) Over/Under - Pet draws a card, you draw a card. Is yours over or under his?  
  
  b) Memory Match
  
2) Feeding System  

  a) Feed pet or their happiness/health decreases
  
  
This code will not run right from the branch. Requires removal of references of images and probably more.

Sorry to dissapoint anyone who was waiting!
